								<span class="d-block">To start the quest, speak with Chancellor Hassan and ask him if he needs any help. He will then tell you to go see Osman, located just outside the palace. He will tell you that Prince Ali has been kidnapped by Lady Keli. You should now go to the east side of Draynor Village and find Leela who can be found wandering in and around the wheat field. Speak with her to get details on the items you need to collect to complete your mission.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">If you do not have a rope, talk to Ned in Draynor Village, and ask him to sell you some for 15 coins. He can also make you some if you have four balls of wool.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Talk to Ned again, this time about a wig. He'll make you a wig if you give him three balls of wool.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Go to Aggie the witch in Draynor Village.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Talk to Aggie about skin paste, and she'll make you some from the redberries, flour, water, and ashes.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Talk to Aggie again about yellow dye and she'll make you some for the onions and the five coins.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Use the yellow dye with the wig from Ned to dye it blonde.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">With the soft clay in your inventory, speak with Lady Keli (found in the prison, east of Draynor Village) and convince her to get a keyprint.</span>
								<img class="pt-2 pb-2 img-fluid" src="../img/quests/Prince_Ali_Rescue_Osman.png">
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Take the imprint along with the bronze bar to Osman to get the bronze key. At this point, you can speak with the Chancellor to get 80 coins from the final reward for your service thus far.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Return to Leela to pick up your duplicate key.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Talk to Leela again, and she will tell you that Joe's weakness is beer. You will need three. Talk to Joe, select the following dialogue option:</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">I have some beer here,</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">This will give him all three beers. Once you have all of the escape equipment and you have immobilized him, use a rope on Lady Keli to tie her up. Use the key to unlock the cell and rescue the prince. At this point you may now pass through the gate to Al Kharid free of charge.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Now return to Hassan at the Al Kharid palace for your reward.</span>
