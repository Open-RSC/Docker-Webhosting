# Tweeki, a Bootstrap based skin for MediaWiki

Tweeki is a skin for **[MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org/)** (1.31+) based on Twitter's 
**[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** (v3.3.7). It tries to implement as much of 
Bootstrap's functionality as possible, allowing to use it very easily and with very 
reduced markup, and features many configuration options.

You can find an instance of Tweeki in action and the extended documentation at the 
project's website **[tweeki.kollabor.at](http://tweeki.kollabor.at/)**

3. Add the following to `LocalSettings.php`:
